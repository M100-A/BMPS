# Version 0.81 - Sunday 11th December 2016

2 more images from Inkeranon.

And a slight change for the WIN32 standalone mini-web-server. After a discussion on /dgg/ I decided to alter the WIN32 mini-web-server to try to automatically start the default web browser.


# Version 0.80 - Friday 2nd December 2016

This is another significant change to the game. For the "local version", has changed from the CURSES version to a standalone mini-web server. The reason for this is to allow for the images to be shown with the text. A CURSES command line version cannot show images (it is strictly for text).

Version 0.70 save files for the CURSES version are not compatible with Version 0.80 mini-web server version.

The CGI-BIN version has also been updated to have the images.

The images are by Inkeranon (http://notreallybuttpants.tumblr.com).

Spoiler pages have been added to the standalone mini-web server, and CGI-BIN versions.

During testing, I found a bug with IE11, and had to change the way that the javascript works so that clicking on the link next to the radio button actually activates the radio button (Firefox was working correctly).


# Version 0.70 - Friday 11th November 2016

Some grammar and spelling errors have been fixed, but most of the changes were with the underlying code.

As part of the CGI-BIN conversion of this project (BMPS), and my two earlier projects (HQWA and XLEA), I found some faults in some of the lower level functions and those have been corrected.

I have added the CGI-BIN conversion directory to this release.

Note: I did not make the CGI-BIN version cross platform capable.


# Version 0.60 - Wednesday 19th October 2016

Initial alpha version released.

There are likely to be some grammatical errors in the dialog, despite the fact that I have performed a number of QC passes (it is difficult when the developer, writer and editor are the one and the same person).


# Project start - Saturday 24th September 2016.
