# Version 0.70 - Friday 11th October 2016

Some grammar and spelling errors have been fixed, but most of the changes were with the underlying code.

As part of the CGI-BIN conversion of this project (BMPS), and my two earlier projects (HQWA and XLEA), I found some faults in some of the lower level functions and those have been corrected.

I have added the CGI-BIN conversion directory to this release.

Note: I did not make the CGI-BIN version cross platform capable.


# Version 0.60 - Wednesday 19th October 2016

Initial alpha version released.

There are likely to be some grammatical errors in the dialog, despite the fact that I have performed a number of QC passes (it is difficult when the developer, writer and editor are the one and the same person).


# Project start - Saturday 24th September 2016.
